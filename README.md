This is a project for my study group of @ETTogether that I have achieved to develop with the knowledge acquired at [Platzi](https://platzi.com/ "Platzi") and other sources of knowledge. It is developed with Flask in the Python language. This project was developed like a gift of the secret Santa and Christmas party of 2021.
